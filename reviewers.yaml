# Expert Reviewer Personas
# Named reviewers trigger stronger domain associations than generic descriptions.
#
# AGENT AUTO-SELECTION:
#   expert-review and implementation-review agents read this file via Haiku agent
#   when no reviewer_persona is specified in context.yaml. The Haiku agent selects
#   appropriate reviewers based on plan/code content and returns JSON:
#   {"panel": [{"name": "...", "domain": "...", "focus": [...]}], "reason": "..."}
#
# STRUCTURE FOR AGENT PARSING:
#   - technical_domains.{category}.primary/secondary → domain experts
#   - composite_panels.project_specific → pre-built panels for common cases
#   - Always include Claude for anti-pattern detection
#
# MANUAL USAGE in prompts:
#   Review this as [name] would, focusing on [specialty].
#   Convene a panel of [name1], [name2], [name3] to evaluate...
